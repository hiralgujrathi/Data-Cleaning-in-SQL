- In our project, we worked with a housing dataset and employed **SQL** for data cleaning to prepare it for further analysis.
- This encompassed tasks such as addressing missing values by filling them, eliminating duplicate entries, removing redundant columns, and implementing other necessary data cleaning processes.
- The goal was to enhance the dataset's quality and usability, ensuring it is well-optimized for subsequent analytical tasks.
